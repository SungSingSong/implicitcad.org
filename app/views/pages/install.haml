      %h1 Install ImplicitCAD

      %p.xlarge-strong 
        You do not need to install ImplicitCAD to try it. You can try it in the 
        %a{href: "/editor"} online editor
        provided by this website.

      %p.xlarge There are three ways you can install ImplicitCAD locally: install a binary, build the latest release, or build the development version. In the future, we hope to provide packages for Linux distributions, but we don't presently.

      =h2_anchor "Download Binary"

      %p.xlarge Download the version for your operating system. It should work as is.

      %p.xlarge This will only give you the extopenscad executable. It will not give you the Haskell libraries. For most peoples' uses this is fine.

      =h2_anchor "Linux Packages"

      %p.xlarge-strong Sadly, ImplicitCAD packages have not been made for any Linux distros yet.

      :markdown

         1. Install GHC and cabal.
             * Debain/Ubuntu: `apt-get install ghc cabal-install`
             * Archlinux: `pacman -S ghc cabal-install`
             * Red Hat/Fedora: `yum install ghc cabal-install`
             * Mac OSX:
                 * Homebrew: `brew install ghc cabal-install`
                 * *Fink doesn't seem to have a package for cabal* Install the Haskell Platform manually as described [here](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/mac.html).
             * Windows: Follows [these install instructions](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/windows.html).
             * [Other unices](http://www.haskell.org/platform/linux.html)
         2. You now have two options for installation:
             * Latest release:
                 * Use cabal to install ImplicitCAD: `cabal update && cabal install implicit`
             * Development version:
                 * Install the dependencies: `cabal update && cabal install hashmap parallel parsec plugins JuicyPixels blaze-builder blaze-markup blaze-svg storable-endian unordered-containers vector-space`
                 * Git clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/colah/ImplicitCAD.git`
                 * cd in: `cd ImplicitCAD/`
                 * cabal install it: `cabal configure && cabal install`

        **I get the error `bash: extopenscad: command not found` (or similar for your shell).** This probably means `~/.cabal/bin/` is not in your `$PATH` variable. Try using `~/.cabal/bin/extopenscad` as your command instead.

        **I get the error `module is not loaded: 'Graphics.Implicit' (./Graphics/Implicit.hs)` when trying to use the ImplicitCAD Haskell library.**  This is most likely a problem with your Linux distro and cabal not playing nice. GHC is not configured to see the ImplicitCAD libraries. You can confirm this by try the test in `~/.cabal/lib/`. If that works, you should be able to use ghc anywhere with the `-Ldir` or `-llib` options. Alternatively, some people have permanently fixed this by doing the cabal install as root.
